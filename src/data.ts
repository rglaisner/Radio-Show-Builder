If I’ve been writing Perl for thirty years and I just want to, you know, whip up a little JavaScript app for my wife... who cares if the internal design is \"perfect\"? My wife doesn't care about lines of code. If the AI can \"vibe\" that into existence... man, let it. It’s about the result, not the ritual."

These AIs, they get ninety percent there, but that last ten percent? It’s full of subtle edge cases. If the code compiles, people just... they just shrug and ship it. It’s not engineering anymore. It’s just... generating future disasters."

You can’t really build a business helping people with these parts. And the controller itself? It still won't work on a desktop OS without Steam running.

It makes it way too easy for some dev to, like, spin up a database that’s just a file on their laptop. Then that file gets copied to a thumb drive or... or Slack. If there’s PII—personal data—in there? You’ve just lost control of your security perimeter. It’s too portable for its own good."
